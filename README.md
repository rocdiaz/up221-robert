## About me
Hi, I'm a second year student in the MURP program at UCLA. My concentration is transportation and I'm interested in parking and housing around Los Angeles. I'm hoping there is data that will be able to be used for visualization. 
## Course
The course will cover spatial analysis in an urban setting while thinking critically about transportation, community development, and design.
## Objectives 
- Learn to take notes on my coding. I have usually been unorganized in my coding classes prior and hope to change that.
- I hope to create legible maps that are useful not only for practicioners, but also people who might not be totally familiar with urban issues

This is Roberto Diaz's repository for UP221 - Introduction to GIS and Spatial Data Science
## About me
Hi, I'm a second year student in the MURP program at UCLA. My concentration is transportation and I'm interested in parking and housing around Los Angeles as well as financial investments in transportation projects. I'm hoping copious amount of data is available. 
## Course
The course will cover spatial analysis in an urban setting while thinking about transportation, community development, and design. The course will also cover data visualization using Python programming to conceptualize urban policy. 
## Objectives 
- Learn to take notes on my coding. I have usually been unorganized in my coding classes prior and hope to change that.
- I hope to create legible maps that are useful not only for practicioners, but also people who might not be totally familiar with urban issues
